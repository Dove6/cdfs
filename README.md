ISO 9660 / ECMA-119 filesystem implementation written in Rust.  It's still very much a work-in-progress.  The project overview lives at Sourcehut:

https://sr.ht/~az1/cdfs/

Usage (cdfs)
---------------
See the examples directory and the [documentation](https://docs.rs/cdfs/) for more information on how to use the `cdfs` library in your project.

Usage (cdfs-fuse)
---------------
If you're just interested in using `cdfs` to mount an ISO, there's a [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) implementation in the `cdfs-fuse` crate.

To install locally:

```
$ cargo install cdfs-fuse
…
   Compiling cdfs-fuse v0.2.4
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 21.97s
  Installing /home/user/.cargo/bin/cdfs_fuse
   Installed package `cdfs v0.2.4` (executable `cdfs_fuse`)
$ cdfs_fuse images/rockridge.iso mountpoint/
2023-09-06T00:00:00.203Z INFO  [cdfs_fuse] NOTE: The filesystem must be manually unmounted after exit
2023-09-06T00:00:00.206Z INFO  [cdfs_fuse] Found POSIX.1 extensions with usable inodes.
2023-09-06T00:00:00.206Z INFO  [fuser::session] Mounting mountpoint/
```

Or run `cdfs-fuse` directly from the workspace root like so:

```
$ cargo run -- images/rockridge.iso mountpoint/
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.15s
     Running `target/debug/cdfs_fuse`
2023-09-06T00:00:00.203Z INFO  [cdfs_fuse] NOTE: The filesystem must be manually unmounted after exit
2023-09-06T00:00:00.206Z INFO  [cdfs_fuse] Found POSIX.1 extensions with usable inodes.
2023-09-06T00:00:00.206Z INFO  [fuser::session] Mounting mountpoint/
…
```
